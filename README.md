# Portfolio Website

Welcome to my portfolio repository! This project is my first step into web development, where I built a personal website using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript.

## Features
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for different screen sizes.
- **Interactive UI**: Smooth animations and user-friendly navigation.
- **Modal PDF Viewer**: Allows users to read embedded PDFs without forcing downloads.

## Challenges & Solutions
### Modal PDF Embedding Issue
I wanted to implement a modal for displaying PDFs, but initially, other elements overlapped the modal content. To fix this:
1. I ensured the modal container had a **higher z-index** than other elements.
2. I applied **position: fixed** to keep it centered and cover the screen.
3. I added a **semi-transparent background overlay** to improve readability.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Structuring the website.
- **CSS**: Styling and layout.
- **JavaScript**: Handling interactivity and modal logic.

## Future Improvements
- Improve accessibility features.
- Add more interactivity using JavaScript.
- Optimize performance for better load times.

## How to Run
Simply open `index.html` in any modern web browser.
